          For 2-5 turns, prevents the opponent from switching and deals 1/16 HP at the end of each turn
          50% chance to discourage this move if the player is already trapped.  50% chance to greatly encourage this move if player is either badly poisoned, in love, identified, stuck in Rollout, or has a Nightmare. Otherwise 50% chance to increase use on your pokemon's first turn being out.
